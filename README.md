# Java Method Overriding Example

This project demonstrates **method overriding** in Java using simple class inheritance between a superclass and a subclass.

## 🧠 Concept

**Method Overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

- `Super` class has a method `display()`.
- `Sub` class overrides the `display()` method using the `@Override` annotation.
